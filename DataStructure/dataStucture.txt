DATA STRUCTURE
========================
- DEFINITION
data structure is a collection of value, which can have relationship among them and they can have functions applied to them.


Think of Data Structure as a container for examples: { A backPack, a shell, a frigidaire etc}

Each of those container have their own purpose about containing object for examples I can put fruit in a shell its gonna go bad, I need to put it a place where its can be store well and I can retrieve it well.
That's all is DATA STRUCTURE.


That's why even about value on computer science based on our scenario, we will need to choose one data structure over another.

There is plenty of Data structure but here we're only gonna focus on those one : 

**ARRAY
**STACKS
**QUEUES
**LINKED LISTS
**TREES
**TRIES
**GRAPHS
**HASH TABLES


[Data structure + Algorithms = Programs]
